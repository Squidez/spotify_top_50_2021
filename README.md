# Spotify top 50 of 2021 Analysis

## Description and objectives
This project was made for the class _Visualisation de donn√©es_ given by Isaac Pante at UNIL.

The main objective was to generate a data visualisation using the D3.js Library.

This project focuses on Spotify's most streamed titles of 2021. It tries to show the realtion between several properties Spotify gives each song and to see if they are correlated. It also allows the users to compare the songs and their properties. 

The website consist of three different visualisation:
1. An interactive radar chart, showing the amount of each propertie, where the user chooses the songs he want's to compare.

2. A scatter plot, showing every song according to two chosen properties.

3. A correlation matrix between the properties.

## Data
The data was extracted using [Organize Your Music](http://organizeyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com/#).
